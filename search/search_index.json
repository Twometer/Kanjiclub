There are three ways to do this: 1. The Editor You can add words manually from sources such as a textbook using the built-in editor: To add a new word, fill out at least the Foreign and Native fields and press Add or the Enter key on your keyboard. The word will now appear on the bottom of the list, and the lesson is saved automatically. To modify or remove an existing word, select a word in the list. The editor is now in change mode. The selected word will be higlighted in the list, and you can update or remove it. To exit the change mode, click the Cancel Edit button. 2. Custom text data The custom text data importer is a powerful tool to get any kind of digitalized vocabulary data into Kanjiclub. It supports plain text files with a template at the beginning. Suppose you have the following dataset from a foreign source in plaintext: ka \u304b ku \u304f For a human, this is clearly the native and the foreign field, each followed by a newline. For kanjiclub to understand such data, we have to insert a template at the top of the .txt file. This is very simple: A template line always begins with a backtick ( ` ). The template for the file above would be: `native ` `foreign ` This tells kanjiclub to interpret each vocab entry as native, followed by newline, followed by foreign and another newline. This works with any of the available vocab data fields foreign , synonym , gender , native , and comment . 3. Importing from existing software Kanjiclub currently supports importing vocabulary from ebVocab and Vocup . Just use the Edit > Import function to upload the files from those projects to kanjiclub, and they'll show up in your lesson overview. If you'd like to add support for other software, feel free to open a pull request on GitHub :^)","title":"Adding vocabulary"},{"location":"adding-vocabulary/#adding-vocabulary","text":"Getting vocabulary into kanjiclub is easy.

To start, simply select the lessons you want to practice from the Practice menu: Click Go , and the software will automatically generate a practice unit for you, and update your strong, medium and weak words according to your performance. Each practice unit will contain 8 words, however you can just keep pressing Enter at the end of a practice to create a new one - That way you can practice for as long as you like.","title":"Practicing"},{"location":"practicing/#practicing","text":"Kanjiclub uses an algorithm similar to spaced-repetition systems to help you learn new vocabulary faster, and keep it in memory for longer.
