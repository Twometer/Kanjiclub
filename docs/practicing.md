# Practicing
Kanjiclub uses an algorithm similar to spaced-repetition systems to help you learn new vocabulary faster, and keep it in memory
for longer.

To start, simply select the lessons you want to practice from the `Practice` menu:

Click `Go`, and the software will automatically generate a practice unit for you, and update your strong, medium and weak
words according to your performance. Each practice unit will contain 8 words, however you can just keep pressing `Enter`
at the end of a practice to create a new one - That way you can practice for as long as you like.
